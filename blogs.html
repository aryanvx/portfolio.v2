                    <p>
                        Things I think about and decide to articulate. Perhaps you've noticed I approach this space with a certain irregularity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I return every month or so, sometimes longer, always when something demands to be said rather than when a calendar dictates it should be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I share stories here, but not the polished kind that corporate blogs traffic in. These are the observations that accumulate in the margins of building and learning, the patterns I notice while moving between code and physics problems, between Pune and the memory of another life.
                    <p>
                        I write when the story insists, when silence would be a disservice to the thinking itself. Not for engagement metrics or algorithmic favor, but because some things, once crystallized in thought, must find their way to words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe no one actually reads these, but that's besides the point, isn't it? The act of writing, of forcing nebulous thoughts into coherent sentences, serves its purpose whether the audience is one or one thousand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You're here now, which means something resonated, or perhaps you're simply curious about what a seventeen-year-old in Pune has to say about code, identity, and the strange mathematics of ambition. Or maybe you're web-surfing. Who am I to judge?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Either way, welcome. Stay as long as the words hold your attention, leave when they don't. I'm not here to perform.
                    </p>
