                    <h2>Currently</h2>

                    <p>
                        I'm preparing for my first JEE attempt in 2028, deepening foundations in math, CS, and markets, and building small, sharp tools that actually ship.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Bio</h2>

                    <p>
                        In early November of 2025, paperwork decided my future where merit could not. I found myself in Pune, India, my formal American education abruptly paused. The transition devastated me. It felt like erasure. But that feeling, as visceral as it was, couldn't have been further from the truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I thought was an ending became the start of something deeper. Like most paths, mine is by no means linear, and I'm struggling now to regain the composure I once had. But one certainty remains: I will not surrender.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work in CS was never about competing with others. It was about an internal drive that must now prove itself more than ever. I focus on data structures and algorithms, automation, and quant-engineering systems that amplify human discipline.
                    </p>

                        I semi-regularly write blogs <a href="blogs.html">here</a> if you'd like to read them.

                        If you are working on something that demands focus under pressure and refuses mediocrity, I'd be pleased to hear from you. Because in this world, the only thing that can turn coal into diamonds is pressure. So come join me in this journey of transformation.
